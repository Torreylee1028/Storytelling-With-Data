# Storytelling With Data
## Data Visualization

### Introduction
Data presentation is about storytelling. Knowing who your audience is can shape the way you present your data and the story that is told. Some ways to tell your story with data can be done through highlighting segments of a graph, utilizing color, textures, and text size to name a few methods. These techniques are explored in this project.

The examples here took the scenario that airlines are a safe way to travel by comparing airline safety data from 1985-2014 with supplementing support of car accident data and airline passenger data. 

### Highlights
*	Basic graphs are created using the library matplotlib in Python
*	Graphs are exported from python and through a vector graphics software Inkscape, the graphs are transformed to the final product, bringing the storytelling piece together

### Navigation
*	Graphs: Python notebook for importing data, feature creation, and graph creation using matplotlib 
*	Storytelling – Infographic: An infographic showcasing finalized graphs
*	Storytelling – Presentation: A presentation showcasing additional finalized graphs

### Examples
Before and after examples of visualization transformations:

#### Before:
The skeleton of the graph is created in python.

#### After:
The finalized version is trasnformed in graphics software to highlight the sections of the graph that extends above a specific threshold. Text placed on the graph is used to emphaise quantity from the y-axis.
